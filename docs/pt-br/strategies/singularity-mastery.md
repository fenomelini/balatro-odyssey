# Singularity Mastery

The **Singularity** theme is all about the power of the one. In a game about building a collection, Singularity Jokers challenge you to do the opposite.

## Playing "Solitaire"
Many Singularity Jokers, like `Solitary` or `One Man Army`, give massive bonuses if you have only one Joker.

### Key Strategies:
- **Build up then Slim down**: Start with many Jokers to survive, then sell them off once you find a powerful Singularity engine.
- **Empty Slots**: Jokers like `Isolated` reward you for NOT filling your slots. This means more money (less spent on Jokers) and more power.
- **The Monolith Strategy**: Some Jokers take up multiple slots but provide massive XMult.

## Essential Singularity Jokers
- **Solitary (Common)**: +12 Mult if you have only 1 Joker.
- **Isolator Dimensional (Uncommon)**: X1.5 Mult if no adjacent Jokers.
- **Vacio Primordial (Rare)**: Destroy all other Jokers for a permanent X5 Mult.
