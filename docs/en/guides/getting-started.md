# Getting Started with Balatro Odyssey

Welcome, traveler, to a mod that expands Balatro to cosmic proportions.

## What is Balatro Odyssey?

Balatro Odyssey is more than just a mod; it's a total expansion that introduces over **1,000 unique Jokers**, 100 new Decks, and a completely new layer of strategic depth.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Thematic Groups
Unlike vanilla Balatro where Jokers are somewhat disparate, Odyssey organizes its content into thematic groups:
- **Singularity**: Focusing on being alone, empty slots, and individual power.
- **Quantum**: Embracing probability, states of existence, and uncertainty.
- **Temporal**: Manipulating time, hands, and the flow of rounds.
- **Dimensional**: Changing how the game board itself works.

### 2. High Stakes
With 1,000 Jokers, the pool is massive. Learning which Jokers synergize within their themes is key to surviving the higher Antes.
