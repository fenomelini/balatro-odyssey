## 🛠️ New Mechanics and Themes

### 🚀 Thematic Categories
Jokers and Decks are divided into families with shared mechanics:
- **Singularity**: Manipulation of isolated cards, "Black Holes" that consume resources to generate massive power.
- **Quantum**: Effects based on superposition (multiple states at once) and uncertainty.
- **Temporal**: Control over the run's time, retriggering effects from past rounds, and Ante manipulation.
- **Corruption & Glitch**: High-risk mechanics that can "break" the game UI or offer astronomical Mults in exchange for instability.

### 💎 Next-Gen Enhancements
Forget just basic Bonus or Mult. Balatro Odyssey introduces:
- **Ruby Card**: An aggressive bonus of pure Mult.
- **Emerald Card**: Dense Chips to guarantee the score.
- **Magic Card**: Chance to generate consumables upon scoring.
- **Wood/Ceramic Card**: Fragile but powerful materials that can break under pressure.

## 🌍 Language Support (Dual Language)

The mod was built with internationalization in mind, offering a native experience in:
- 🇧🇷 **Portuguese (Brazil)**: Full localization following the official base game terms.
- 🇺🇸 **English (US)**: Full technical and flavor text localization.
